# React Context Tasks App

This application belongs to the set of tutorials made with [React](https://es.reactjs.org/).

Made with function components and Hooks. It is an example to learn how to pass properties between child components by using React's **useContext** and **useReducer**

This application consists of registering a series of tasks in a form with its title and description. If we navigate to the main page we can view all the tasks as well as edit, delete or mark them as done.

We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) library to style the application.

To load them just use:
